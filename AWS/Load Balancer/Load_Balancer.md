# ⚖️ Load Balancers in AWS

AWS offers **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets like EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, or Lambda functions. It improves:

- ✅ High availability
- ✅ Fault tolerance
- ✅ Scalability

## 📌 Types of Load Balancers

| Load Balancer Type           | Protocols Supported     | Best For                               | OSI Layer |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | HTTP, HTTPS              | Web apps, microservices (host/path-based routing) | Layer 7 |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**     | TCP, UDP, TLS            | High-performance, low-latency apps     | Layer 4 |
| **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**    | GENEVE (port 6081)       | 3rd-party appliances (firewalls, DPI)  | Layer 3 |
| **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**     | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL    | Legacy applications                    | Layer 4 & 7 |

- **Features**:
  - Path-based and host-based routing
  - Native support for containers (ECS/EKS)
  - WebSocket support
  - Integrated authentication via Amazon Cognito or OIDC
  - HTTP/2 support

---

### 🟦 Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- **Use Case**: High-performance, low-latency applications (gaming, streaming, financial systems)
- **Features**:
  - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS)
  - Static IP and Elastic IP support
  - TLS offloading
  - Preserves source IP
  - Scales automatically to millions of requests per second

---

### 🟨 Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
- **Use Case**: Deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual appliances like firewalls, deep packet inspection (DPI), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)
- **Features**:
  - Operates at Layer 3
  - Uses GENEVE protocol
  - Transparent network traffic forwarding
  - Centralized management of security appliances

---

### 🟥 Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
- **Use Case**: Legacy applications (should not be used for new designs)
- **Features**:
  - Operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7
  - Limited routing capabilities
  - No support for modern features like host/path-based routing
  - Less flexible compared to ALB/NLB

# 🎯 Target Groups vs 🛡️ Trust Store in AWS

---

## 🎯 What are Target Groups?

Target Groups are used in AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to manage and route traffic to a set of registered targets.

### 🔹 Features:
- Supports EC2, Lambda, IPs as targets.
- Each group can be attached to **ALB**, **NLB**, or **CLB**.
- Health checks are performed per target group.
- Allows path-based or host-based routing via ALB.
- Supports weighted routing for blue-green or canary deployments.

### 🔸 Use Cases:
- Microservices architecture (route `/api` to API servers, `/media` to file servers)
- High availability & fault-tolerant deployments
- Load balancing between different versions of services

---

## 🛡️ What is a Trust Store?

A Trust Store is a collection of trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates used to verify peer/client identities in TLS communications.

### 🔹 Features:
- Used in mTLS (Mutual TLS) setups.
- Central to services like **AWS Private CA**, **App Mesh**, and **IoT Core**.
- Typically stores PEM-encoded CA certificates.
- Validates authenticity of client or service certificates.

### 🔸 Use Cases:
- Mutual TLS authentication between microservices.
- Device authentication in IoT deployments.
- Secure communication in service meshes (App Mesh with Envoy proxies).

| **Contains**          | Registered EC2/IP/Lambda targets       | Trusted CA certificates                          |
| **Security Role**     | Distributes & health-checks targets    | Validates identity via certificates              |
| **Use Case**          | Load balancing, routing traffic        | mTLS, secure communication, service trust anchor |

> ✅ **Tip**: Use Target Groups for routing and scaling. Use Trust Stores for securing identity and establishing trust in communication.
