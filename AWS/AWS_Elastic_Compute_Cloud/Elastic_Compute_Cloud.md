# 📘 AWS EC2 Documentation

## 📌 What is EC2 in AWS?
Amazon **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
It allows you to launch and manage virtual servers (instances) on-demand without having to buy physical hardware.  

Think of it like **renting a computer in the cloud**—you pay for what you use, scale up when traffic spikes, and scale down when it’s quiet.

## 📌 Scenario  
Let’s say you’re building an **E-commerce website**:  
- During normal days → You need **2 servers** to handle traffic.  
- During festival sales → Traffic increases 5x, so you launch **10 servers** instantly using EC2.  
- After the sale → You scale down back to 2 servers to save cost.  

👉 With EC2, you only pay for the extra servers **when you need them**.

## 📌 Benefits of EC2
✅ **Scalability** – Increase or decrease capacity in minutes.  
✅ **Pay-as-you-go** – No upfront investment, you pay only for what you use.  
✅ **Variety of Instance Types** – Choose based on CPU, memory, storage, or GPU needs.  
✅ **Global Availability** – Deploy in multiple AWS regions worldwide.  
✅ **Integration with AWS Services** – Works seamlessly with S3, RDS, ELB, Auto Scaling, etc.  
✅ **Secure & Reliable** – Built on Amazon’s secure infrastructure.
